# StacklineAssessment

This is the completed stackline front-end assessment for Alex Tan. After cloning the repository, run npm install and then npm start to run the project locally. I used React.js as the main framework for building out components, used Redux for state management, React-Router-Dom to navigate between an all products page and a product details page. With a small project like this, generally Redux is not necessarily warranted but I was told to showcase my ability to do so.

The portion of the assessment that gave me a hard time was the line graph using d3. It is somewhat new to me but I managed to get the data points to render along with a monthly x-axis. In the mockup I noticed there were two lines but I assumed that is meant for multiple years so I left mine at one line. I also tried to make the page as responsive as possible but I wasn't exactly sure how these big graphics were supposed to look when compressed. I ended up changing the layout and compressing elements instead of using scrolling to see the whole view.

The sales table can be sorted by any of the fields. By default it is sorted descending by the date but you can click on the same field to reverse the sort or click on a new field to initially sort by that field descending.

Thank you to the engineers that will be looking over this assessment and thank you for the opportunity. I hope to hear back from you soon.
